        I am a Web Designer.
        I am a firm believer in lifelong learning,
        and I am constantly seeking ways to enhance my knowledge and skills.
        I am an avid reader and enjoy staying up-to-date with
        the latest industry trends and advancements.
        I am not afraid to ask questions or seek guidance when needed
        as I believe collaboration and continuous improvement are
        key to personal and professional growth.

        In addition to my intellectual pursuits, I also value the importance of
        interpersonal connections.

      <p id="project"><b>Project Description: Automatic Roof Design System</b><br>
        <!-- <img src="auto.jpg"><br> -->

        As part of a team project, I played a key role in developing an innovative Automatic Roof Design System. The
        objective of the project was to create a software solution that streamlines the process of designing roofs for
        residential and commercial buildings.

        My responsibilities included designing and implementing the algorithms that automate the roof design process.
        I collaborated closely with architects, engineers, and software developers to understand the requirements and
        translate them into functional code. Leveraging my expertise in [mention relevant programming languages or
        technologies], I developed an intuitive user interface and integrated it with the backend algorithms.

      <p id="pr"><b>Project Description: Music Recommendation Based on Facial Expressions</b><br>

        As a part of my research project, I spearheaded the development of an innovative Music Recommendation System
        that utilizes facial expressions to curate personalized playlists. The aim of the project was to explore the
        connection between human emotions and music preferences, leveraging computer vision techniques and machine
        learning algorithms.
        We collected a vast dataset of facial expressions captured through facial recognition technology while
        participants listened to a wide range of music genres. This dataset served as the foundation for training our
        machine learning models.

        Using deep learning algorithms and feature extraction techniques, I developed a robust facial expression
        recognition model capable of accurately detecting emotions such as happiness, sadness, excitement, and more.
